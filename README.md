# hECMAthlon
*(the not refactored code can be found in the starter code)*


**Refactor Task**

The hECMAthlon is a feature competition where programmers can measure their strength in refactoring javascript code. Every competitor gets a codebase and their task is to refactor the code using the newest features of the ECMAScript. You are lucky and your friend is part of the judge of the competition. He shared with you the codebase and the main point of view of the judgment. Before you participate in the real competition you need to practice it.




**General requirements**

- Every functionality works after the refactoring
- All the functions are declared as arrow functions



**Pretty Simple Web server written in Node.js**
